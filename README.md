# Kickstarting with Excel

## Determining factors of successful Kickstarter campaigns

### Overview of Project
Louise, a US playwright, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play ***Fever***. Her estimated budget is over $10,000. I'll be analysing several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover trends which will help Louise determine both the ideal time to launch her campaign and a reasonable goal for funding her project. This analysis will evaluate the success of theater Kickstarter campaigns based on launch date and initial funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Starting with a dataset of over 4000 Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of industries around the world from 2009-2017, I filtered the data to view only theater Kickstarter campaigns within these years. The result is an analysis of 1393 theater crowdfunding projects.

As we can see in the chart below, overall there are more *successful* theater funding campaigns than *failed* campaigns each month. The data indicates that success rates are highest in May and reach a low point in December, suggesting that people are less likely to pledge during the end of year holidays.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next I looked at the data for only *plays* within the theater Kickstarter projects. Of the 1393 theater kickstarter projects, 1066 are for funding plays. 

Since Louise has a proposed budget of $10,000 for her play, ***Fever***, let's look at the percentage of successful and failed projects by funding goal.




### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Analysis conducted on almost 1400 theater funding projects include 1066 plays, but also 140 musicals and 187 spaces.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
